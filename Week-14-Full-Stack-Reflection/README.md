# 💡 Weekly Reflection: Full-Stack Progress (ALX Frontend + Backend) 📅
---

### 🎨 Frontend (React + Tailwind CSS)

I worked on integrating **Tailwind CSS** with **React** components as part of my ALX frontend track this week.  
The focus was on responsive design, modular styling, and semantic component structure.

🔑 **Key Highlights**:
- ✅ Created a reusable `UserProfile` component with Tailwind classes.
- 📐 Implemented responsive padding (`sm:p-4`), spacing (`my-20`), and container width settings.
- 🖼️ Styled images with full-width and rounded corners for profile presentation.
- 📝 Applied custom fonts and font sizes for headings (`text-4xl`) and paragraphs (`text-lg`, `text-gray-600`).
- 🌀 Added hover transitions and responsive behavior using utility classes.
- ⚡ Ensured clean and maintainable structure by using separate CSS files and component directories.

### 🛠 Backend (Advanced API Development with Django REST Framework)

I continued the backend journey with **Advanced API Development** using **Django REST Framework**.  
This project emphasized scalable, secure API design with proper data modeling and permission controls.

🔑 **Key Highlights**:
- ✅ Built class-based and generic API views with DRF.
- 🔗 Created serializers for custom models and nested relationships.
- 🧭 Configured routers and URL patterns for clean, versioned API endpoints.
- 🔒 Implemented token authentication and role-based permissions.
- 🧪 Practiced testing endpoints and response structures using Django’s built-in tools and Postman.
