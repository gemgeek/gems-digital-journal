# üìñ My Full-Stack Weekly Reflection üöÄ

This week was a solid journey across frontend, backend, and shell scripting. I tackled four major areas: **React state management, responsive UI, Django signals, API optimization, and shell scripting with variables and expansions**.

## üé® Frontend Reflection: State & Responsive Design

### üßÆ Assignment 1: Counter App (State Management)
We rebuilt the same app three times to explore different state management techniques:
- **useState Hook** ‚Äì simple for local state, but limited to single components.
- **Context API** ‚Äì introduced shared global state via a `CountProvider` and `useCount` hook.
- **Redux Toolkit** ‚Äì robust and scalable with `store`, `slice`, `useSelector`, and `useDispatch`. Ideal for large apps.

### üè° Assignment 2: Property Listing App
Focused on real-world UI development:
- **Dynamic Routing**: Used `[id].tsx` for property pages in Next.js.
- **Component Composition**: Built reusable pieces like `BookingSection` and `ReviewSection`.
- **Responsive Design**: Tailwind‚Äôs responsive classes (`md:`, `lg:`) made layouts adapt smoothly.
- **Typed Data**: Defined strong TypeScript interfaces and mock data for realism.

## üöÄ Backend Reflection: Signals & APIs

### üì° Django Signals & ORM Optimization
- **post_save**: Auto-created `Notification` when a new `Message` was saved.  
- **pre_save**: Logged edits to `MessageHistory`.  
- **post_delete**: Cleaned up messages when a user was deleted.  
- **ORM Optimization**: Solved N+1 queries with `select_related` & `prefetch_related`.  
- **Custom Manager**: `UnreadMessagesManager` made querying cleaner.  
- **Caching**: Used `@cache_page(60)` to reduce DB load.

### ‚úàÔ∏è Travel App API (Django REST Framework)
- **ModelViewSet & Routers**: Delivered full CRUD for `Listing` and `Booking` with minimal code.  
- Felt like a true productivity boost ‚ö°.

## üêö Shell Scripting Reflection: Variables & Expansions

This week I also worked on **ALX Shell Variables and Expansions**.  
I wrote Bash scripts to practice key shell concepts:

- **Variables**: Creating local and global variables using `set` and `export`.  
- **Expansions**: Arithmetic (`$((...))`), brace expansions, and alias creation.  
- **Text Processing**: Using commands like `tr`, `grep`, `cut`, and `printf`.  
- **Base Conversion & ROT13**: Solving puzzles like binary ‚Üí decimal, decimal ‚Üí hex, and text encoding.  
- **File Permissions**: Remembering to `chmod +x` scripts for execution.  

This gave me hands-on experience with **Linux shell scripting, environment management, and text manipulation**.

## üß© Key Learnings & Challenges
- Major issue: **persistent `ModuleNotFoundError`** caused by environment corruption.  
- Solution: **hard reset** (delete venv, caches, migrations) ‚Üí rebuild step by step.  
- Lesson: sometimes debugging is about fixing the environment, not the code.
