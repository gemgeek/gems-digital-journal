# 🌟 Week 16 Full-Stack Reflection   

As part of my **ALX Software Engineering journey**, this week in **frontend dev**, we focused purely on fine-tuning workflow with components and tests. Here's what I accomplished:  

## 📌 Key Highlights  
- **TodoList Component**: Implemented a reusable and functional `TodoList` component with clean structure.  
- **Testing Component**: Set up proper testing to ensure components are working as expected.  
- **File Structure Adjustments**:  
   - Learned the importance of **correct file placement** for automated checks.  
   - Discovered that the test file (`TodoList.test.js`) needed to exist both in the **components folder** and **src folder** to pass all checks.  
- **Debugging & Problem-Solving**: Faced challenges with failing checks but resolved them by carefully restructuring files and re-running tests.  

## 💡 Lessons Learned  
- File structure matters as much as the code itself.  
- Automated checks are strict, but they help reinforce best practices.  
- Patience and experimentation are key – sometimes moving files around is part of the learning curve.  

# Backend Development (Social Media API) 🚀

## Overview  
This week, I worked on the backend side of a **Social Media API project** using **Django and Django REST Framework (DRF)**. The project focused on building a robust backend capable of handling user authentication and social media features.  

## Key Achievements ✨  
- **Set up Django project** 🛠️: Created a new Django app and configured `settings.py` for backend development.  
- **Configured WSGI application** 🔧: Linked the project name to `social_media_api.wsgi.application` for proper deployment settings.  
- **Version control** 🔄: Maintained updates and commits using **Git**; ensured all changes passed the ALX project checker.  
- **Checker success** ✅: All backend tasks successfully passed the checker after multiple refinements and testing.  
- **Explored deployment options** ☁️: Learned about **Heroku** deployment (created an app and remote repository) but decided not to deploy yet to maintain checker stability.  
- **Learned Postman’s purpose** 📬: Understood that Postman is used for **API testing**, not deployment.  

## Lessons Learned 📚  
- Keeping changes simple and committing frequently helps prevent errors.    

## Tools & Technologies 🧰  
- **Django**  
- **Django REST Framework (DRF)**  
- **Git & GitHub**  
- **Heroku (explored)**  
- **Postman (learned)**

**Reflection** 💡: This week, I gained more confidence in handling backend settings and understood the workflow of an API project.  

## 🔄 Other Activities  
- **Capstone Milestone**: Finalized my **capstone project** and successfully **recorded my presentation**.

- **Professional Development**: Commenced **ProDev Frontend and Backend modules**, setting the stage for deeper learning.  

## 🎯 Next Steps  
- Focus on personal project.
