# ðŸŒŸ Week 16 Full-Stack Reflection   

As part of my **ALX Software Engineering journey**, this week in **frontend dev**, we focused purely on fine-tuning workflow with components and tests. Here's what I accomplished:  

## ðŸ“Œ Key Highlights  
- **TodoList Component**: Implemented a reusable and functional `TodoList` component with clean structure.  
- **Testing Component**: Set up proper testing to ensure components are working as expected.  
- **File Structure Adjustments**:  
   - Learned the importance of **correct file placement** for automated checks.  
   - Discovered that the test file (`TodoList.test.js`) needed to exist both in the **components folder** and **src folder** to pass all checks.  
- **Debugging & Problem-Solving**: Faced challenges with failing checks but resolved them by carefully restructuring files and re-running tests.  

## ðŸ’¡ Lessons Learned  
- File structure matters as much as the code itself.  
- Automated checks are strict, but they help reinforce best practices.  
- Patience and experimentation are key â€“ sometimes moving files around is part of the learning curve.  

## ðŸ”„ Other Activities  
- **Capstone Milestone**: Finalized my **capstone project** and successfully **recorded my presentation**.  
- **Professional Development**: Commenced **ProDev Frontend and Backend modules**, setting the stage for deeper learning.  

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps  
- Backend assignments are next! Ready to dive into APIs, logic, and database work.
