# üöÄ ProDev Full-Stack: Weekly Reflection üåü

This week in Backend was a deep dive into building and securing a real-world backend application with Django. We tackled two major projects, going from basic API construction to advanced concepts like middleware and debugging complex issues.

## Assignment 1: Building a Robust Messaging API üí¨

Our first goal was to create a secure and functional messaging API using Django REST Framework.

### üõ°Ô∏è Task 1: Implementing JWT Authentication
We started by setting up the core of our security system.
- Installed `djangorestframework-simplejwt` to handle token-based authentication.
- Configured `settings.py` by adding the new apps and setting up the `REST_FRAMEWORK` defaults.
- Set up the `/api/token/` and `/api/token/refresh/` endpoints in `urls.py`.

### üîê Task 2: Custom Permissions
With users logging in, we needed to control what they could access.
- Created a custom permission class, `IsParticipantOfConversation`, to ensure users could only interact with conversations they were a part of.
- Applied this permission to our `ConversationViewSet`.
- Set a global default permission (`IsAuthenticated`) in `settings.py` as a security best practice.

### üìÑ Task 3: Pagination & Filtering
To handle large amounts of data efficiently, we added pagination and filtering.
- Installed `django-filter` to enable powerful query filtering.
- Created a custom `MessagePagination` class to serve 20 messages per page.
- Built a `MessageFilter` class to allow filtering messages by `sender` and `timestamp`.

### üß™ Task 4: API Testing with Postman üìÆ
We verified that everything worked as expected using Postman.
- Created a collection to organize all our API requests.
- Set up requests to get a JWT token, create conversations, fetch conversations, and send messages.
- A key learning was using Postman's scripting features to automatically save the JWT `accessToken` to a collection variable for use in subsequent requests.

### üõ†Ô∏è Key Debugging Moments (Assignment 1)
- **Database Initialization:** We encountered `no such table` and `InconsistentMigrationHistory` errors, which taught us the importance of the `makemigrations` -> `migrate` -> `createsuperuser` workflow, especially after creating a custom user model or resetting the database.
- **Custom User Model:** We fixed an `AttributeError: 'User' object has no attribute 'id'` by correctly configuring `SIMPLE_JWT` in `settings.py` to use our custom primary key (`user_id`).
- **Django Admin:** We learned that custom models must be registered in `admin.py` to appear in the admin panel and how to use `UserAdmin` to make the interface more powerful.

## Assignment 2: Mastering Django Middleware üåâ

The second project focused on intercepting and processing requests using middleware, a powerful tool for cross-cutting concerns.

### üìù Task 2: Request Logging Middleware
- Created our first middleware, `RequestLoggingMiddleware`, to log the timestamp, user, and path of every incoming request to a `requests.log` file.

### ‚è∞ Task 3: Time-Based Access Control
- Implemented `RestrictAccessByTimeMiddleware` to return a `403 Forbidden` error if a user tried to access the app outside of business hours (9 AM - 6 PM).

### üö¶ Task 4: IP-Based Rate Limiting
- Built a middleware (named `OffensiveLanguageMiddleware` as per the prompt) that cleverly tracked the number of `POST` requests from each IP address, blocking them if they exceeded 5 messages per minute. This was a great introduction to stateful middleware.

### üëë Task 5: Role-Based Permissions
- Created `RolePermissionMiddleware` to check the `user.role` attribute and deny access to users who weren't 'ADMIN' or 'HOST'.

### üêõ The Great Checker Showdown (A Debugging Saga)
A significant part of this assignment was battling a buggy automated checker. This was a valuable, real-world lesson in debugging.
- We learned that error messages can be misleading (`settings.py doesn't exist`).
- We tried multiple valid project structures (`config` folder, matching project name folder).
- Ultimately, we discovered the solution was to **flatten the project structure**, moving the settings files to the project root. This taught a valuable lesson: sometimes the problem isn't the code, but the environment or the tools used to check it. Your persistence and debugging here were awesome! üéâ
