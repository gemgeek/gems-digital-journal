# 💻 Week 8 Recap (Full Stack Journey)

Welcome to Week 8 of my full stack software engineering journey.  
This week was a healthy blend of backend logic, frontend creativity, and celebrating new milestones across platforms. Here’s a quick breakdown:

---

## 🗄️ Backend Engineering (ALX)

This week, we dove into **Database Management Systems (DBMS)** and **SQL fundamentals**. I learned about:

- What databases are and how they’re structured
- SQL syntax and queries
- Creating tables, inserting data, and retrieving it efficiently
- Understanding keys, constraints, and table relationships

It felt like learning the foundation of every app I’ve ever used — and that perspective was powerful. We were also given a practical assignment to create tables, which helped reinforce the theory.

## 🎨 Frontend Engineering (ALX)

Things got interactive this week as we explored **Advanced DOM Manipulation**. Highlights include:

- Creating a **Dynamic Quote Generator** using JavaScript
- Practicing how to **manipulate the DOM** in real-time
- Storing data using **Web Storage (localStorage)** for persistence
- Parsing and managing **JSON** objects

This assignment really stretched my JS skills and gave me a solid grasp of how dynamic websites work under the hood.

## 🎓 ALX Milestone: AI for Developers

I officially completed the **AI for Developers** course offered by ALX!  
This course gave me deep insight into:

- What Artificial Intelligence really is
- Real-world use cases of AI in products and platforms
- Responsible AI use as a developer
- How to get started integrating AI into apps
It was inspiring and has opened up a whole new layer of thinking for my tech journey.

## 🌐 Mimo Milestone

I also hit a big personal learning milestone on Mimo:

### 🏆 Certificate Earned:
- ✅ **Professional Full Stack Web Developer (Mimo)**

Mimo continues to be my sidekick for on-the-go practice and mini projects — and this certificate marks the progress I’ve made over months of consistent study.

## 🐍 Python Developer in Progress

Though I’ve completed several modules, I’m still deep in my journey to master **Python**. It’s a language I truly enjoy, and I’m working hard to understand its logic, syntax, and use in backend systems, data structures, and real-world apps.

## 💬 Weekly Reflection

This week reminded me that building great software means learning how everything connects — from data on the backend to interactivity on the frontend.

The more I learn, the more I realize how far I can go. I’m not just collecting certificates — I’m **becoming a builder**, one week at a time.
