## Week 01 - Backend ðŸš€
Status: Onboarding week  

Backend began with a gentle start. Nothing heavy yet, but the energy is building up!

- I created a visual roadmap for my backend journey to stay organized and intentional.
- I completed my onboarding and passed the intro assessment.
- I made a reflective post on Twitter to mark the beginning of this part of my full-stack path.

Curious about what challenges and breakthroughs the backend will bringâ€”ready to embrace them all!
