# ProDev Journey – Weekly Reflection

## 🌐 ProDev Front-End

This week in the ProDev front-end course, I worked on documenting and planning the **UI/UX design** for the Airbnb Clone project.  

- 🎨 Learned how to outline **design goals** and create structured sections in the README.  
- 🖌️ Practiced documenting **wireframes and Figma styles** (colors, typography).  
- 🧩 Explored key **UI components** like Navbar, Property Card, and Footer.  
- 👥 Reflected on the importance of a **user-friendly design** in booking systems.  

✅ **Key takeaway:** I now understand how **planning UI/UX** ahead of coding helps the whole team stay aligned.

## 🖥️ ProDev Back-End

This week in the ProDev back-end course, I focused on the **project’s structure and security**.  

- 👩‍💻 Documented **team roles and responsibilities** (Backend Dev, DBA, QA, etc.).  
- 🛠️ Listed and explained the **technology stack** (Django, PostgreSQL, GraphQL, etc.).  
- 🗄️ Outlined the **database design** (Users, Properties, Bookings, Reviews, Payments).  
- 📋 Broke down the **features** of the Airbnb Clone system.  
- 🔐 Learned about **API security measures** (authentication, authorization, rate limiting).  
- 🚀 Explored the importance of **CI/CD pipelines** (GitHub Actions, Docker).  

✅ **Key takeaway:** I can see how **backend planning** ensures scalability, security, and smooth deployment.

## 💡 Reflection

Working through both the front-end and back-end ProDev tasks showed me the value of **clear documentation** and **role planning** in software projects. It felt less like “just coding” and more like building a system with structure, teamwork, and long-term vision in mind.
