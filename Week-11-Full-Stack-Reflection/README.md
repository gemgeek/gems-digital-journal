# 💻 Week 11 – Full Stack Journey Reflection | ALX SE Program

This week was a **celebration of growth, precision, and persistence** across both frontend and backend. I tackled advanced concepts, debugged like a pro, and even made it to the **top 10** on the backend leaderboard, finishing at **#7**. 🎯💯

## 🧠 What I Worked On

### 🔙 Backend (Django)

- Created a fully functional **Library Management System** with:
  - ✅ Role-based views for Admin, Librarian, and Member
  - 🔐 User authentication: register, login, logout
  - 🛡️ Permission-based book management using `permission_required`
  - 📚 Book CRUD operations (Add, Edit, Delete)
  - 🌐 URL routing and dynamic views
- Deepened my understanding of:
  - Class-based vs function-based views
  - Template rendering logic
  - Django Admin & custom permissions

### 🎨 Frontend (React)

- Built interactive components using **React**:
  - 🧠 Practiced **state management** with `useState`
  - 🔁 Implemented **conditional rendering** and dynamic lists
  - 🧭 Worked with **React Router** for navigation
  - ✅ Introduced to **React Hooks** like `useEffect`
- Styled components for a smoother and more responsive UI
