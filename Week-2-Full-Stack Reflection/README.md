# Week 2: Git & GitHub Basics 👩‍💻⚙️

## Overview ❤️
This week, I focused on understanding the foundational concepts of Git and GitHub. I completed both frontend and backend assignments using PowerShell. It was so exciting practicing real Git commands. I truly felt like a pro!

## Tasks Completed ✅
- Initialized a local Git repository
- Pushed it to GitHub
- Cloned a remote GitHub repository
- Created a new branch and made changes
- Resolved merge conflicts using PowerShell
- Documented the entire process with a screen recording

Using the command line made me feel so powerful, seeing that blue screen, typing commands, resolving merge conflicts, it felt like magic. I’m truly enjoying the learning process.
