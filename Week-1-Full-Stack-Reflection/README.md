### Learning Highlights

#### Backend
- Command Line Interface (CLI):  
  Got introduced to the power of the terminal — navigating files, creating directories, and feeling like a tech ninja!

- Sandbox Mastery:  
  Practiced in a sandbox — created, edited, and ran files. Getting hands-on made the commands stick like magic.

- AI Integration:  
  Learned how to incorporate AI to simplify tasks and debug smarter — loving this boost in productivity!

#### Frontend
- Fundamentals Unlocked:  
  Covered the basics of frontend development — HTML, CSS, and JavaScript intros. Some overlap with backend made it easier to catch on quick!

- Assignments Done & Dusted:  
  Completed all tasks for the week, even reported issues early on Discord — boss move!

### Personal Learning (Mimo App)

- Daily Practice:  
  Learning frontend skills on my own using the Mimo app — completed HTML, CSS, and currently learning JavaScript.

- Real-World Project:  
  Built a Linktree-style page from scratch! It's my first personal mini-project and I’m proud.

- #1 on the Leaderboard:  
  I’ve been holding the top spot and pushing through every lesson with consistency and passion!

### Community & Bonus Wins

- Daily.dev Engagement:  
  Hit a 46-day streak and got gifted 350 cores from a developer — one step closer to $1,000!
