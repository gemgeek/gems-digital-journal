# 📓 Week 15 Full-Stack Reflection   

## 🌸 Frontend (Tailwind CSS)  
This week on the frontend side, I worked on a **recipe app** styled with **Tailwind CSS**.  
The project focused on:  
- Practicing Tailwind utility classes for **responsive layouts**  
- Designing clean, minimal UI with **cards and grids**  
- Improving my **component organization** and understanding how styling flows naturally with Tailwind  

Overall, it was fun seeing how quickly Tailwind allows me to build modern UIs without writing much custom CSS.

## ⚙️ Backend (Django)  
On the backend side, I continued deepening my skills with **Django** by building a new app.  
The project emphasized:  
- Setting up models, views, and URL configurations  
- Working with **forms and templates** for data input and display  
- Handling structured routes to improve **user experience**  
- Testing functionality and pushing changes to GitHub  

This helped reinforce how Django apps are structured and how backend logic connects with frontend templates.

## 🌱 Personal Update  
On a personal note, I’m currently making progress on my **capstone project**. It’s still in development, but I’m steadily building it step by step. The journey has been challenging yet exciting, and I’m motivated to keep pushing forward until I bring the vision fully to life.

✅ **Reflection:**  
Week 15 gave me the chance to strengthen both **frontend design skills** with Tailwind CSS and **backend development** with Django. Balancing these with my capstone has been intense, but it’s teaching me consistency, discipline, and how to enjoy the process of building.
