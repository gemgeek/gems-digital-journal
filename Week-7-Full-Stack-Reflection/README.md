# 🧠 Matilda's Week 7 Recap (ALX + Mimo + Personal Growth)

Hello world! 👋🏽  
Welcome to another chapter of my tech journey — documenting my weekly learning, breakthroughs, and bugs (because... they always show up 😅).

## 💻 Frontend Engineering (ALX)

This week, we had an intense but exciting assignment — to **implement a full webpage design from scratch**, without using any libraries. The project included:

- Structuring the site using **HTML5 best practices**
- Styling with **pure CSS**
- Applying **responsive design principles**
- Ensuring **accessibility**
- Organizing code in modular files (`0-index.html`, `0-styles.css`, etc.)
- Using assets provided in a ZIP file: fonts, images, icons

### 🐞 Debugging Horror Story (DHS)
Let’s talk about the monster of the week:  
I spent *three full days* wondering why my icons in the "What We Do" section weren’t showing up. I checked DevTools, cleared my cache, verified file paths, refreshed like a madwoman — still nothing.

Turns out...  
It was an **underscore**.  
I used `_` instead of `-` in a class name.  
Three days. One character. 

Moral of the story: Check. Your. Class. Names. Carefully.

## 🧠 Backend Engineering (ALX)

On the backend side, we continued our journey into **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**, with a focus on:

- Classes and inheritance  
- Polymorphism  
- Creating and managing a **Library System**  
- Using magic methods and clean Python code

It’s been challenging but so rewarding. OOP concepts are clicking more each week!

## 🌐 Mimo Milestones

This week, I proudly completed the **Full-Stack Web Developer Certificate** on Mimo! 🎉  
I’ve been using Mimo as part of my self-paced learning routine and it’s paying off.

### 🏅 Mimo Certificates So Far:

- ✅ HTML
- ✅ CSS
- ✅ JavaScript
- ✅ SQL
- ✅ Backend 
- ✅ Frontend
- ✅ Full-Stack Web Developer

Next goal: Keep practicing, building more mini-projects weekly, and graduating as a python developer.

## 🤖 AI for Developers (ALX)

I also completed the **AI for Developers** course from ALX — and it was one of the most insightful tech experiences I’ve had so far. It helped me understand:

- What AI is and isn’t
- Real-world applications and tools
- How developers can begin using AI responsibly and creatively

Definitely planning to integrate more AI into my future projects!

## 💬 Reflection

This week reminded me why I’m here:  
To **do hard things**, grow through the frustration, and come out stronger and smarter.  

Grateful for the ALX ecosystem, Mimo’s hands-on learning, and my own persistence.  
On to the next ✨
