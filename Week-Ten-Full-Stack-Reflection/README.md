# 🧠✨ Week 10 Fullstack Reflection – Backend & Frontend Highlights  
_Django + React_

Hey there! 💖 Here’s a sweet little reflection from my recent backend & frontend learning adventures. I deep-dived into Django for backend logic and React for frontend interactivity, and let me just say… I’m evolving. 🐛➡️🦋

## 🐍 Backend – Django (Python)

### 🔧 What I Built:
- 📁 Created a Django project `LibraryProject`
- 📚 Built a `Book` model with `title`, `author`, and `publication_year`
- 🧪 Used Django ORM to perform CRUD:
  - ✅ Create: Added George Orwell’s *1984*
  - 🔍 Retrieve: Fetched book data
  - ✏️ Update: Renamed to *Nineteen Eighty-Four*
  - 🗑️ Delete: Removed the record like a pro
- 🛠️ Registered model in `admin.py`
- 🧑🏽‍💻 Used Django Admin interface for data management

> This part of the journey made me feel like a real backend engineer 😌💻

## ⚛️ Frontend – React (Vite)

### 🎨 What I Practiced:
- ⚡ Set up my project with `Vite + React`
- 💌 Created reusable components: `Header`, `MainContent`, `Footer`, `WelcomeMessage`, and `UserProfile`
- 🧬 Passed props to display dynamic user info
- 💅🏽 Styled my profile card for extra cuteness
- 🖼️ Added screenshots + README documentation

> I loved how visual React is. JSX + props = magic ✨
