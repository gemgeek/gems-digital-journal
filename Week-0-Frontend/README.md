## Week 0 - Frontend ðŸš€ 
Status: Onboarding week  

This week was calm but exciting. I officially began my journey as a full-stack engineer, starting with the front-end track.

- I designed a visual roadmap to guide my progress throughout the course.
- I completed my onboarding activities and passed my first assessment.
- I made my first post on Twitter to introduce my journey and connect with other techies.

I'm eager and a little nervous, but mostly *hopeful* for what's ahead. Here's to growth, grit, and gorgeous UIs!
