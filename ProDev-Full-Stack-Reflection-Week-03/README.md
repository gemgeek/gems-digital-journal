# ProDev Full-Stack Weekly Reflection Journal

## 🐍Backend Reflection 

### 📌 Summary of What I Did
This week, I worked on backend concepts focusing on **Python decorators, context managers, and asynchronous programming** with SQLite.  

- Built decorators to **log queries**, **manage DB connections**, **handle transactions**, **retry on failure**, and **cache query results**.  
- Created **custom context managers** for opening/closing database connections and executing queries safely.  
- Implemented **asynchronous database queries** with `aiosqlite` and `asyncio.gather` to run multiple queries concurrently for better performance.  

👉 Overall, I learned how to write **cleaner, safer, and faster code** by letting Python handle database connections, transactions, and concurrency automatically.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools
Here are the main tools and technologies I used:

- **Python** – Core language  
- **SQLite** – Database  
- **asyncio** – For asynchronous programming  
- **GitHub** – Version control & repo hosting

## ✨ Reflection
- I now understand how **decorators** can wrap functions to add powerful features.  
- I learned that **context managers** (`with` statements) help prevent mistakes by ensuring resources (like DB connections) are always cleaned up.  
- I practiced **asynchronous programming**, which lets multiple tasks run together, making my programs more efficient.  

This backend foundation feels solid, and I’m excited to connect it with the **frontend** part of my learning next!
