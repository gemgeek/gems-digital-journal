# 🌟 Week 9: Catch-Up, Growth & New Chapters — My Fullstack Journey with ALX

This week marked a **catch-up week** in our ALX Fullstack Software Engineering journey — a valuable pause to reflect, reset, and re-energize.

## 🔁 ALX Catch-Up Week Highlights

We were encouraged to:
- Revisit unfinished assignments and past concepts
- Reflect on lessons learned so far
- Gear up for the next phase of the program

I was also selected to support fellow learners by sharing helpful tips and resources in the **Catch-Up Squad** forum — an opportunity I embraced wholeheartedly.
## 🔁 What I Did This Week

### ✅ Personal Review & Contribution
- Revisited key concepts in **backend** and **frontend**.
- Shared debugging tips and beginner-friendly breakdowns with peers.
- Took time to re-read past notes and practice small Python scripts.

### 📚 Mimo Progress
- **🎉 Completed my Python Developer Path** on Mimo and received my certificate!
- Currently learning **Swift** — and loving the challenge of a new language.

### 🎓 New Academic Milestones
- Got **admitted and awarded a scholarship** to study **Computer Science** at the *University of the People* 🎓
- Accepted into a **short course on Applied AI** at *WorldQuant University* 🧠🤖

### 🍿 Recharge Time

## 🔥 Looking Ahead

I feel **refreshed, excited, and more prepared** for the next chapter of my fullstack engineering journey. These little pauses are just as important as the grind — they allow us to come back stronger.

> Onward to deeper concepts, more code, and greater breakthroughs. 💪💻
