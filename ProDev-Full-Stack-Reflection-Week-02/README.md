## ‚ú® Reflection

This week, I strengthened my **front-end fundamentals** (semantic HTML, CSS layouts, scalable React/Next.js with Tailwind CSS) and **back-end foundations** (database querying, Python generators, and Django setup).  

I feel more confident in building **full-stack applications** that are **scalable, responsive, and well-documented**, following industry best practices.
