## 📝 The "Missing" Weeks

If you’ve been following my journey, you might have noticed a silence in the repository for the past few weeks.  
That silence wasn't inactivity, it was pure, focused execution.

At Week 12, the curriculum shifted from weekly lessons to our final challenge: **Project Nexus (The Capstone)**.  
I stopped writing daily updates so I could pour all my energy into building **GemConnect**, a full-stack social media mobile application.

Here is the breakdown of this intense 5-week sprint to the finish line.

---

## 🗓️ Week 12: Inception & Architecture
**Focus:** Planning, Design, and Environment Setup.  
**The Pivot:** We paused standard lectures to start Project Nexus.

### ✅ Key Wins
- Designed the **ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram)** for the database.  
- Created **High-Fidelity UI designs for 19 mobile screens**.  
- Initialized the **Django backend** and **React Native (Expo)** frontend repositories.

### ⚠️ Challenges
- Choosing the final tech stack.  
- Structuring folders and modules for long-term scalability.

---

## 🛠️ Week 13: The Heavy Lifting (Backend & UI)
**Focus:** Writing the core logic and building the interface.

### 🔧 Backend
- Built the **GraphQL API** using Graphene-Django.  
- Implemented **JWT Authentication**.  
- Created Models: **User**, **Post**, **Like**, **Comment**.

### 🎨 Frontend
- Built the **static UI** for Feed, Profile, and Auth screens using TypeScript.

### ✅ Key Wins
- Successfully got **GraphQL Playground** working locally.  
- Finished major layouts for **Profile** and **Home** tabs.

## 🔗 Week 14: Integration Hell to Heaven (Current Week)
**Focus:** Connecting Frontend to Backend & Deployment.

### 😵 The Struggle
Connecting a physical iPhone (Expo Go) to a local Django server running inside WSL.  
Network errors, firewall issues, IP conflicts, everything went wrong.

### ✨ The Breakthrough
Using **Ngrok** to tunnel the backend.  
Seeing the first **“Login Successful”** alert and fetching **real data** from the database was the best moment of the entire course.

### 🚀 Deployment
- **Backend:** Deployed to Render (PostgreSQL + WhiteNoise).  
- **Frontend:** Published via **EAS (Expo)**.

---

## 🏁 Week 15: Polish & Presentation (Upcoming)
**Focus:** Documentation, Slides, and Demo Video.

- Refining all READMEs.  
- Recording the **demo video** showing the user journey.  
- Preparing the **Google Slides** deck for the final defense.

## 🎓 Week 16: Graduation!
**Status:** Loading… ⏳

This week marks the end of the program.  
I will be submitting all final links and celebrating the transition from **Student → Full-Stack Software Engineer**.

## 💡 Reflection

Building **GemConnect** taught me more in 4 weeks than the previous months combined.  
It forced me to think like an engineer, not just writing functions, but **architecting systems**, solving multi-layer integration issues, and managing a real development workflow.

**Next Update:** I will return in Week 16 with graduation photos and my final certificate! 🎓✨
