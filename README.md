## About Me

Welcome to my digital journal!

I’m on a journey to becoming a badass Full-Stack Engineer through the ALX Software Engineering program. Here, I’ll be documenting my weekly experiences in frontend and backend development—what I’m learning, what I’m struggling with, and how I’m growing.

This GitHub repo is more than code. It’s a space for:
- Weekly logs of my progress
- Insights from my learning journey
- Honest reflections—wins, fails, and everything in between
- Snapshots and visuals from my tech life

## My Weekly Logs
Each week, you’ll find updates in two folders:
- frontend/: My journey with HTML, CSS, JavaScript & more
- backend/: My experience with servers, APIs, Python, databases & logic

Thank you for being part of my journey!

Stay tuned,  
Gem Geek❤️
