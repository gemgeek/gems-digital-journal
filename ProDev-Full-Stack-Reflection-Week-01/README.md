## üñºÔ∏è ProDev Frontend: Wireframing & Design

### 1. Documenting Features & Functionalities
- Created a **README.md** listing core features of the Airbnb clone project (user registration, property listings, bookings, payments, etc.).

### 2. Wireframing Basics
- Documented the **importance of wireframing** in the design process.
- Explained how it guides both design and development.

### 3. Wireframing Tools
- Compared common wireframing tools.
- Recommended **Figma** as the main tool, with notes on why it‚Äôs effective.

### 4. Benefits of Wireframing
- Explained how wireframing improves communication across teams.
- Showed how it reduces design misunderstandings before coding.

### 5. Wireframing in Practice
- Documented a **real-world scenario** where wireframing identified usability issues early.
- Concluded with how wireframing ensures a more user-friendly final product.

## ‚öôÔ∏è ProDev Backend: Database & System Documentation

### 1. Database Normalization
- Reviewed schema design for redundancies.
- Normalized tables up to **3rd Normal Form (3NF)**.
- Documented normalization process in `normalization.md`.

### 2. Database Schema (DDL)
- Wrote **SQL CREATE TABLE scripts** with primary keys, foreign keys, and constraints.
- Added indexes for optimized queries.
- Documented in `database-script-0x01/schema.sql`.

### 3. Seeding the Database
- Created `seed.sql` with **sample realistic data** for Users, Properties, Bookings, and Payments.
- Ensured data reflected real-world usage.

### 4. System Documentation
- Designed **Use Case Diagram** (Draw.io).
- Converted use cases into **User Stories** (`user-stories.md`).
- Built a **Data Flow Diagram (DFD)**.
- Designed **Flowcharts** for backend processes.

### 5. Requirements Specification
- Wrote **technical requirement specs** for:
  - User Authentication  
  - Property Management  
  - Booking System  
- Covered API endpoints, input/output formats, validation, and performance needs.  
- Documented in `requirements.md`.

## üåç Reflection

Working through both **frontend (wireframing/design)** and **backend (database & documentation)** tasks provided a clear view of the **full software development lifecycle**:

- **Frontend** emphasized **planning, visual design, and usability**.
- **Backend** emphasized **data structure, process flow, and technical requirements**.
- Together, the assignments connected **user experience** with **system logic**, giving a well-rounded full-stack perspective.
