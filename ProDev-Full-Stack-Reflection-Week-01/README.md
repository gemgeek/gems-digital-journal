# 📓 ProDev Digital Journal – Week 2 (Front-End)

## 🌟 Weekly Reflection: Requirement Analysis Project

The first thing we tackled this week was **Requirement Analysis Project**, which focused on building a solid foundation for a booking management system by documenting, analyzing, and structuring requirements. The tasks helped me understand how requirement analysis fits into the **Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)** and why it is crucial for successful project execution.

### 🛠️ Key Activities Completed
- **Repository Setup**: Created a new GitHub repository `requirement-analysis` and added the initial README.md file.  
- **Defined Requirement Analysis**: Explained the concept and importance of requirement analysis in the SDLC.  
- **Importance of Requirement Analysis**: Highlighted reasons such as reducing misunderstandings, aligning stakeholders, and preventing costly errors.  
- **Key Activities**: Documented activities like gathering, elicitation, documentation, analysis/modeling, and validation.  
- **Types of Requirements**: Differentiated between **Functional** and **Non-functional requirements** using examples from the booking management system (with a helpful comparison table).  
- **Use Case Diagram**: Designed and included a use case diagram (`alx-booking-uc.png`) to visually represent system actors and interactions.  
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Explained its importance and provided an example for the **Checkout Feature**, ensuring clarity, alignment, and testability.  

### 💡 Key Learnings
- Requirement Analysis is the **blueprint of software development**, ensuring all stakeholders share the same vision.  
- **Functional vs Non-functional requirements** helped me see how systems must balance features with performance, security, and usability.  
- Visual tools like **Use Case Diagrams** make complex systems easier to understand.  
- Writing **Acceptance Criteria** gives a concrete way to measure when a feature is “done.”  

### 🚀 Reflection
This week sharpened my skills in **structured documentation** and **requirement clarity**. I now appreciate how much planning happens **before coding even begins**. This foundation is critical for avoiding miscommunication and ensuring smooth development down the line.

## 📌 Wireframing Project

Secondly, I worked on the **Wireframing: From Wireframe to Prototype** project. The goal was to understand wireframing as a crucial step in UI/UX design and how it supports software development.  

### 🔑 Key Learnings & Activities
- **Introduction to Wireframing**  
  Learned what wireframing is and why it is important in guiding the design process.  

- **Key Elements of a Wireframe**  
  Explored layout structure, navigation, content placement, and functionality, with examples of how they shape user experience.  

- **Types of Wireframes**  
  Compared **low-fidelity vs. high-fidelity wireframes** in a table format.  
  Analyzed a real-world high-fidelity wireframe (“Project Airbnb”).  

- **Wireframing Tools**  
  Reviewed different tools and highlighted **Figma** as a collaborative, powerful option for creating wireframes and prototypes.  

- **Benefits of Wireframing in Software Development**  
  Understood how wireframes improve communication among team members, reduce risks, and guide design decisions.  

- **Wireframing in Practice**  
  Reflected on a real-world scenario where wireframing identified usability issues early (checkout flow in a booking platform).  
  Learned how issues were resolved before development, saving time and ensuring a smoother user experience.  

### 🌟 Reflection
This project showed me how **wireframing bridges design and development**. By testing ideas visually, I saw how usability problems can be caught early, which avoids costly fixes later. Wireframing also makes teamwork easier since everyone can see and agree on the design before coding begins.
